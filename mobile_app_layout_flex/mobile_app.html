            <p>Praslin is the second largest island (38.5 km2) of the Inner Seychelles, lying 44 km (27 mi) northeast of Mahé in the Somali Sea. Praslin has a population of around 7,533 people and comprises two administrative districts: Baie Sainte Anne and Grand' Anse. The main settlements are the Baie Ste Anne, Anse Volbert and Grand' Anse.

            </p>
            <p> It was named Isle de Palmes by explorer Lazare Picault in 1744. During that time it was used as a hideaway by pirates and Arab merchants. In 1768 it was renamed Praslin in honor of French diplomat César Gabriel de Choiseul, duc de Praslin.

            <p>Praslin is known as a tourist destination with several hotels and resorts, as well as a number of beaches such as Anse Lazio and Anse Georgette.

            </p>
            <p>It has substantial tracts of tropical forests with birds such as the endemic Seychelles bulbul and the Seychelles black parrot. The Vallée de Mai Nature Preserve, established in 1979,[1] is known for the unique coco de mer and vanilla orchids. It has been reported that General Charles George Gordon of Khartoum (1833-1885) was convinced that Vallée de Mai was the Biblical "Garden of Eden".[citation needed]

            </p>
            <p>Praslin is home to Praslin Island Airport, while surrounding islands include Curieuse Island, La Digue, Cousin Island, Cousine Island and Aride Island. There are a few near offshore islets including Round Island (0.193 km2) and Chauve Souris (0.007 km2), both of which have hotel accommodations.

            </p>
            <p>Twice in two weeks in August 2011 bull sharks entered the so-called 'safe bathing' area inside the coral reef of Anse Lazio and attacked and killed swimmers less than 100 ft (30 m) from shore.[2] However, to put this in perspective, these were the first recorded fatal shark attacks in Seychelles for 50 years and none have been recorded after 2011.

            </p>
            <p>A large area in the south of the island has been designated as Praslin National Park and surrounding areas Important Bird Area.
